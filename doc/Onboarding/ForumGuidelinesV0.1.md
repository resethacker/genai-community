## **Guideline: Forum Code of Conduct - read before you post!**


The mission of the Expert Forum is to provide a peer-to-peer and direct support channel for experts performing customer service for qualified networks, expert moderation and automations work with Movate OnDemand (Directly.com).
This center is for sharing Movate and network announcements, providing a space for experts to get help from their peers, and a channel to reach out to the Movate Operations team. It's a place for discussing best practices and where OnDemand collaborates with experts to improve and expand the platforms they use.

This document outlines the code of conduct for experts working with Movate OnDemand. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure a productive, respectful, and secure environment for all experts.

**The Golden Rules**
The forum thrives when every expert follows these rules and helps to address those who don't in respectful ways.

### 1. Be Kind and Respectful

● We are an Inclusive community and ask that you are kind and respectful towards other experts and OnDemand team members on forum or DM or outside the network (Do not reach out to expert outside the Movate).

### 4. Protect Privacy

>
●	This forum is primarily for peer-to-peer interaction and is not the place to post about specific account problems. This includes issues like being removed from a network, banned from OnDemand, or concerns about account security. For these issues, use the "Ask Directly" widget or fill out an appeal form.
>
●	Unless explicitly stated, forums are not used by OnDemand to resolve individual account issues, gather product feedback, collect user information, manage policy, or handle user reports.

### 6. Expert Communication Regarding Clients
●	We do not encourage experts to engage with the Client team for several reasons. 
>
●	We have observed a trend where experts express their intention to reach out to clients for clarifications, expert-related concerns, or to redirect issues. Please refrain from doing this. Instead, direct your inquiries to the OnDemand Operations team or your Community Manager. This approach allows us to manage the community more effectively.
>
●	For platform bugs or client user issues, inform the Directly Operations team via the forum. If reported to client support, update the forum.

### 7. Feedback & Ideas

●	We value your input! Share your thoughts on how to improve the Expert Forum.
●	Post your ideas for improving the OnDemand platform and processes and engage with others' ideas.
●	Important Note: For platform bugs, client user-related issues, 2FA, network return requests, account status, bug reports, and other similar issues, please use the "Ask Directly" widget or the specific feedback forms provided.
