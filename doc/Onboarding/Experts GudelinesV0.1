2. Guidance on Introducing, first response, reroute, closing tickets and response time expectations in [Network] 
3. Best practices for Tickets Handling
4. URGENTLY Reroute: How to Handle Urgent or High-Priority Issues?
5. Offline Routing of Cases:


 
1. Understanding Tickets Information:
•	Always verify the information provided before offering advice or a resolution. Ensure that the customer has provided all necessary details, and that no information is missing.

•	If unsure about certain details, ask clarifying/probing questions or share your understanding of the ticket with the customer, rather than making assumptions or providing generic suggestions.

2. Guidance on Introducing, first response, reroute, closing tickets and response time expectations in HP:
•	When introducing yourself, just refer to your name. If asked, experts can say they help with HP questions, but don’t call yourself things like 'expert,' 'user,' ‘HP employees’ or ‘Movate Expert’.

Hi < Customer name >
My name is < Expert name > HP user and expert. I am happy to help you today.

Ask probing / Provide resolution.

Description:
In case his chat is disconnected, please don’t worry. The link provided to you will remain open for 72 Hrs. Upon clicking on that link, you will be redirected to the chat where you left. 



•	Do Not Disclose Freelancer Status: Never inform customers that you are a freelancer or contractor.  

o	In your first response, ask probing questions or open-ended questions to understand an issue better or suggest what the person can do first to fix it. (Do not provide generic suggestions or incorrect HP KBA)

o	The Time to First Respond is 3 Min what does it mean for the Experts. Once Expert claims the Question, they should Respond it with the 3Min. 
 
•	When to Reroute: If Ticket or issue requires additional support from HP and experts should not engage with these tickets.

Reroute Templet: “This ticket requires additional support. I am routing this case to the support team that can provide more assistance to you.” 

Do NOT use: “escalating,” “[Network],” or “Product Engineering Team.”

Note: In this guideline under Urgently reroute, offline reroute and addressing/rerouting tickets related to specific [Network] products section, you will find multiple scenario/examples of rerouting.
•	When closing a ticket in Network  
o	It's not mandatory to use this signature. 


•	 This will help ensure consistency and professionalism in our communications across the HP network.

•	For [Network] (Button): Experts should use “Mark as Resolved” frequently to prevent tickets from timing out and when waiting for a customer response. IT helps experts:

o	Pauses the SLA clock, giving more time to work on tickets.
o	Prevents mid-ticket timeouts due to inactivity.

•	For [Network]: Expert should use “Waiting on Customer Action” when the expert reasonably believes that the ticket has been addressed or resolved.  


•	Response Time Expectations: All Experts need to pick these hours for North America cases.
	[Network]	Eg HP
TTFR	X Mins/Hrs	3 Min. (Note: For all the HP Products.)
ORT (Ongoing Response Time)	X Mins/Hrs	NA.
MPT (Maximum Processing Time)	X Hrs	NA
.
•	Few clarifications on response time expectations in [Network] : 

o	HP Tickets automatically time out after X days.
o	Once Experts answer the questions make sure experts use the “Marked as Resolved" Button on the OnDemand Platform.

3. Best practices for Tickets Handling
•	OnDemand, HP Account & MSP ID Access:
•	For New Experts - You should keep your OnDemand Profile including network tags, Skills tags, email address, first & last name up to date.

•	Network tags: 

However, only HP eg T2 experts require an HP ID. Once onboarded, please coordinate with the OnDemand Team on Ask Directly/Forum in case you need to request HP ID access. This will allow you to view attachments, KBAs, ID and other [Network] -related resources.  

Note: Sharing/Selling your account or ID with another person will lead to direct removal from the program and permanent ban from the OnDemand program. 
 
•	Customer Experience (Expectation with [Network] experts):

•	Having an amazing Customer experience is core responsibility for the support team.

•	When the support case is going back and forth with customer and support, it causes dissatisfaction. Frame your questions in such a way that you get all the information you need before you can propose a solution to the customer. 

•	Handling [Network] tickets: 
  
•	Always avoid offering incorrect advice. When in doubt or unsure of the answer and other relevant procedures, it's better to reroute the case to T2 or leave it for an expert that actually knows the answer rather than provide incomplete/risky or misleading information.


•	When you provide an answer to the customer, share the KBA or the help portal links as well. Suggestion: If the solution or workaround needs a SYSTEM CHANGE, such as deleting an item or changing a setting, you should refer to a document. If the solution does not lead to a system change, like refreshing or creating a new entry, referring to a document is optional.


•	It's Mandatory for experts to verify KBAs/HP documentation before sharing solutions and experts must not share or refer to any non-HP site while offering solutions to customers.

•	Experts should only use HP Approved mode of Inbound and outbound communication with HP Customers (Email, SoMe Chats and HP Cloud/Avaya Telephony).


•	Experts should NOT support other HP products under the wrong component. If an incident is incorrectly created in a particular HP product but pertains to another HP product, experts should ensure it is rerouted to HP for proper handling.

•	Experts should not provide an irrelevant or excessive text that does not address the customer's concern. Responses should be concise, clear, and directly related to the issue. If further clarification is needed, break down the steps in an easy-to-follow manner.

•	Experts must understand when to pursue further and reroute/move the case back to HP. If you see the need to continuously ask for screenshots to understand the customer’s setup, it advised you move the case back to HP with the reroute code “Additional Support required from T2” 

E.g. If you have already had 5 interactions, it is high indicator that this case would need to be accessed by HP to further assist the customer.

•	Don't give advice on issues outside of the product area of the ticket - Reroute instead to next level of support. 

•	Experts should not download customer data and save information on their desktops. Experts should promote a clean desk policy and paperless environment. Both at B&M and WFH.  

If required remind the customer to avoid sharing credentials, logs, or other sensitive information while seeking advice.

•	Lastly, Experts should not advise customers to upload the images/screenshots to any third-party services (imgbb.com, Google Drive, One Drive, https://paste.pics/, etc.) for Privacy and Security reasons. Customers might upload images with PII on them. Instead, you can ask the customers to copy and paste the error message or code in the chat, or to describe the issue as best as they can.
 
•	  Best Practices Process Violations:   
•	Ensure adherence to all the practices to avoid the process violations.

•	All responses should be based on reliable resources such HP KBS, if unsure revisit the HP KBS resources, OnDemand education Hub & Forum Articles: Regularly review the guidelines set by HP and Movate to stay updated.

•	Avoid responses that might leave the customer confused or with more questions. 

4. URGENTLY Reroute: How to Handle Urgent or High-Priority Issues?
•	System Down or Critical Errors: Any case marked as an urgent issue, where the system is down or severely impacted, must be routed to HP immediately with clear documentation and escalation flags.

•	Tickets related to log, Credential, HP warranty, HP partners, HP system access, HP subscriptions check, cases requiring internal HP queues, cases requires advanced debugging [e.g., syntax errors, HP note issues], and If a response provides incorrect or harmful information that could potentially damage the system [e.g., critical configurations], immediately route the case to HP.

•	If a case comes through in a language other than English, reroute immediately.
•	Please reroute any questions with a mention of "Russia" or "Belarus."

•	Choosing the correct reroute code
o	Ensure to use the right reroute code when moving a case back to HP.
o	The system access required should be used when you see the need to access the customer’s system in order to further troubleshoot the issue.
o	HP Action required to be used when to further assist the customer HP support would need to work with internal teams. 

•	Cases or tickets where customers request HP experts in the following scenarios need to be immediately rerouted to Tier 2 experts.
o	When documentation needs to be updated
o	The current issue references other cases for context, or customer asks for a specific HP person.
o	Customer raises a license or contractual Issues: In cases where the license or contractual details need checking or clarification, please reroute to the HP Tier 2.
o	If the customer asks to modify, delete, or edit database or table data.

•	Urgently Rerouting Process Violations:
o	Do not attempt unnecessary troubleshooting steps when rerouting is required or mentioned in the HP Expert guidelines.


o	Avoid delaying rerouting or rerouting without informing the customer, as this can cause user frustration, we always recommend experts to inform customers before rerouting and to use the approved Rerouting template:

“ This ticket requires additional support. I am routing this case to the support team that can provide more assistance to you.”

Note: Do NOT use: “escalating,” “HP,” or “Product Engineering Team.”



o	Also, experts should use the 'Engineer requested' to reroute tag ONLY when the customer requests an HP engineer or references a previous case. Otherwise, they can use the 'HP Action Required.'

o	For reroutes, experts must include a summary of actions taken and HP documentations/KBAs shared to avoid repetition by HP experts. 

5. Offline Routing of Cases:
•	When a customer requests or asks to check the issue over a connection/screen share, callback, a Teams or Zoom meeting invite, screen sharing for troubleshooting, or remote access to their computer, ask the customer to elaborate their issue and assure them that you'll do your best to assist. If the customer insists on another form of communication, inform them that you'll reroute them to HP for further assistance and proceed to do so immediately. Do not attempt to resolve these cases independently.

•	 No Direct Meetings or Call Requests with Customers: Under no circumstances are you to initiate or accept direct meetings or call requests with customers outside of the platform's established communication channels. All communication must remain documented within the ticket system. If the customer requests to check the issue over a connection / screenshare, callback, or a team or zoom meeting or remote access to their computer, inform them that you are rerouting the case back to HP for further assistance.  

•	If a customer says they’re going to create a new ticket or contact HP, inform them that there’s no need to do so, as you will reroute them to HP and proceed to do so immediately.

•	No Instructing Customers to Raise New Tickets: You must not ask customers to close their current ticket and open a new one for any reason. Your responsibility is to resolve the issue within the existing ticket or route it appropriately if necessary.    

•	The ONLY time experts can encourage someone to open a new ticket is if a brand new, unrelated issues is raised by the customer  
•	If the ticket is a follow-up or a customer asks to assign it to a specific support engineer, reroute the ticket to HP using the reroute option immediately.
•	If you are unable to assist the customer, run out of ideas, or realize only HP can fix the issue, please properly inform the customer of the reroute and reroute the ticket to HP using the reroute option immediately.

•	Offline Rerouting Process Violations:
•	Attempting unnecessary troubleshooting steps when offline rerouting is required or mentioned in the guidelines.
•	Delaying rerouting and Rerouting without informing the customer.
•	Not providing helpful resources (Kbs etc) before offline rerouting.  

·	Data and Access Control Concern: 

•	Experts are prohibited from sharing their credentials needed to access HP applications. 

•	Experts must proactively notify any violations of the HP security requirements and any incidents of breach to the OnDemand operation team so the Team can escalate the issue to the internal cyber and information security within 12 hours.

•	Experts are prohibited from generating, accessing, or downloading any confidential data from HP applications containing customer data. Any need to access such data must be explicitly informed to the OnDemand Community Manager or OnDemand Operations team.

•	Experts should not enable, activate, nor make operational any software or hardware or ai capabilities for Data collected.

·	AI Guidelines: Do and Don’t

•	Use AI to craft better answers: It can make complex ideas easier to understand.
•	Verify AI-generated information: Always check the accuracy of what you're sharing. Your knowledge is key to ensuring that what you share is correct.

•	Cite your sources: If you need to reference excerpts from AI sources, be sure to credit the origin of the information.

•	Don't copy and paste AI responses: Make sure you craft your own answers and adjust them to reflect your unique voice.
