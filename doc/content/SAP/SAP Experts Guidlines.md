===================================================
## Guidance for SAP Experts - Article

1. Understanding Tickets Information:

Always verify the information provided before offering advice or a resolution. Ensure that the customer has provided all necessary details, and that no information is missing.
If unsure about certain details, ask clarifying/probing questions or share your understanding of the ticket with the customer, rather than making assumptions or providing generic suggestions.

2. Guidance on Introducing, first response, reroute, closing tickets and response time expectations in SAP:

When introducing yourself, just refer your name. If asked, experts can say they help with SAP questions, but don’t call yourself things like 'expert,' 'user,' or 'SAP team member.' 
Please refrain from using emojis, emoticons, or non-text characters in your initial introduction statement to the customer as it does not set the professional tone.
  Do Not Disclose Freelancer Status: Never inform customers that you are a freelancer or contractor.  

In your first response, ask probing questions or open-ended questions to understand the issue better or suggest what the person can do first to fix it. (Do not provide generic suggestions or incorrect Kbs/Snote)   
When to Reroute: If Ticket or issue requires additional support from SAP, and experts should not engage with these tickets.  

Reroute Templet: “ This ticket requires additional support. I am routing this case to the support team that can provide more assistance to you .”

Do NOT use: “escalating,” “SAP,” or “Product Engineering Team.”
Note: In this guideline under Urgently reroute, offline reroute and addressing/rerouting tickets related to specific SAP products section, you will find multiple scenario/examples of rerouting.

When closing a ticket in SAP Network  
It's mandatory to use this signature. 

First Name
External | On behalf of SAP Support
 This will help ensure consistency and professionalism in our communications across the SAP network.
For SAP Resolve (Button): “Mark as Resolved” button is now “Waiting on Customer Action”. Experts should use “Waiting on Customer Action” frequently to prevent tickets from timing out and when waiting for a customer response. IT helps experts:

Pauses the SLA clock, giving more time to work on tickets.
Prevents mid-ticket timeouts due to inactivity.
Enhances efficiency in managing multiple tickets.
For SAP Helpdesk: Expert should use “Waiting on Customer Action” when the expert reasonably believes that the ticket has been addressed or resolved.  

Response Time Expectations: All Experts need to pick these hours for North America Cases and other country cases.

SAP Help Center

SAP_Resolve

IRT (Initial Response Time)

10 Min

2 Hrs. (Note: For all the SAP_Resolve Products.)

ORT (Ongoing Response Time)

20 Mins.

36 Hrs.

MPT (Maximum Processing Time)

2Hrs

60 Hrs.

.

Few clarifications on response time expectations in SAP, SAP Help Center and SAP_Resolve: 

SAP tickets automatically time out after 21 days, regardless of the IRT, ORT & MPT status.
IRT, ORT & MPT is about preventing breaches, but it does not control ticket closure.
If a ticket is marked "Waiting on Customer Action," it stays open for 21 days if the customer does not respond.  

### 3. Best practices for Tickets Handling

OnDemand & SUERID Access:

For New Experts - You should keep your OnDemand Profile including network tags, Skills tags, email address, first & last name up to date.

SAP Network has three tags: SAP, SAP Resolve, and SAP Help Center.
However, only SAP_Resolve experts require an S-user ID. Once onboarded, please coordinate with the OnDemand Team on the Forum to request S-user ID access. This will allow you to view attachments, KBAs, S-notes, and other SAP-related resources.  

Note: Sharing/Selling your account or SUSERID with another person will lead to direct removal from the program and permanent ban from the OnDemand program.  

Customer Experience (Expectation with SAP experts):

Having an amazing Customer experience is core responsibility for the support team.
When the support case is going back and forth with customer and support it causes dissatisfaction. Frame your questions in such a way that you get all the information you need before you can propose a solution to the customer. 
Handling SAP tickets: 
  
Always avoid offering incorrect advice. When in doubt or unsure of the answer and other relevant procedures, it's better to reroute the case to SAP or leave it for an expert that actually knows the answer rather than provide incomplete/risky or misleading information.
 SAP supports the standard code. No suggestions on custom code should be provided to the customers .Customer should never be told that he would be given ideas to change the standard system behavior.

Modifications to the standard system behavior should not be suggested by the experts.

When you provide an answer to customer, share the KBA or the help portal links as well. Suggestion: If the solution or workaround needs a SYSTEM CHANGE, such as deleting an item or changing a setting, you should refer to a document. If the solution does not lead to a system change, like refreshing or creating a new entry, referring to a document is optional.

It's Mandatory for experts to verify KBAs/SAP documentation before sharing solutions and experts must not share or refer to any non-SAP site while offering solutions to customers.

Experts should NOT support other SAP products under the wrong component. If an incident is incorrectly created in a particular SAP product but pertains to another SAP product, experts should ensure it is rerouted to SAP for proper handling.

Example: If an incident is incorrectly created in Access Control but pertains to another SAP product (Upgrade, LMS, etc..,) experts should ensure it is rerouted to SAP for proper handling.
Experts should not provide an irrelevant or excessive text that does not address the customer's concern. Responses should be concise, clear, and directly related to the issue. If further clarification is needed, break down the steps in an easy-to-follow manner.
Experts must understand when to pursue further and reroute/move the case back to SAP. If you see the need to continuously ask for screenshots to understand the customer’s setup, it advised you move the case back to SAP with the reroute code “System Access required” 

E.g. If you have already had 5 interactions, it is high indicator that this case would need to be accessed by SAP to further assist the customer.
 Don't give advice on issues outside of the product area of the ticket - Reroute instead.
Do NOT use the SAP ID in your account pic/ profile Pic
Remind the customer to avoid sharing credentials, logs, or other sensitive information while seeking advice.

Lastly, Experts should not advise customers to upload the images/screenshots to any third-party services (imgbb.com, Google Drive, One Drive, https://paste.pics/, etc.) for Privacy and Security reasons. Customers might upload images with PII on them. Instead, you can ask the customers to copy and paste the error message or code in the chat, or to describe the issue as best as they can. 

  Best Practices Process Violations:   

Ensure adherence to all the practices to avoid the process violations.
All responses should be based on reliable resources such SAP KBS/SNOTES, if unsure revisit the SAP KBS/SNOTES resources, OnDemand education Hub & Forum Articles: Regularly review the guidelines set by SAP and Movate to stay updated.
Avoid responses that might leave the customer confused or with more questions. 

### 4. URGENTLY Reroute: How to Handle Urgent or High-Priority Issues?

System Down or Critical Errors: Any case marked as an urgent issue, where the system is down or severely impacted, must be routed to SAP immediately with clear documentation and escalation flags.

Tickets related to log, Credential, SAP cloud partners, SAP system access, SAP License check [e.g., HEC system, PAY_CLOUD, ECS, etc.], cases requiring internal SAP queues [e.g., PART-BKL, HST], cases requires advanced debugging [e.g., syntax errors, SAP note issues], and If a response provides incorrect or harmful information that could potentially damage the system [e.g., ZDO key requests, critical configurations], immediately route the case to SAP.

If a case comes through in a language other than English, reroute immediately. You can do this as a silent reroute.

Please reroute any questions with a mention of "Russia" or "Belarus."

Choosing the correct reroute code

Ensure to use the right reroute code when moving a case back to SAP.
The system access required should be used when you see the need to access the customer’s system in order to further troubleshoot the issue.
SAP Action required to be used when to further assist the customer SAP support would need to work with internal teams. 
Cases or tickets where customers request SAP experts in the following scenarios need to be immediately rerouted to SAP.
When documentation needs to be updated
If the issue is not a UPG topic and needs to be rerouted
The current issue references other cases for context or customer asks for a specific SAP person.
Customer raises a license or contractual Issues: In cases where the license or contractual details need checking or clarification, please reroute to the SAP.
UXR related cases should be rerouted to SAP Team.
If the customer asks to modify, delete, or edit database or table data.
Urgently Rerouting Process Violations:
Do not attempt unnecessary troubleshooting steps when rerouting is required or mentioned in the SAP Expert guidelines.

Avoid delaying rerouting or rerouting without informing the customer, as this can cause user frustration, We always recommend experts to inform customers before rerouting and to use the approved Rerouting template:

“ This ticket requires additional support. I am routing this case to the support team that can provide more assistance to you .”

Note: Do NOT use: “escalating,” “SAP,” or “Product Engineering Team.”

While rerouting, experts should use the “System Access Required” tag ONLY when the customer explicitly requests system access. Otherwise, they can use the 'SAP Action Required.'
Also, experts should use the 'Engineer requested' reroute tag ONLY when the customer requests an SAP engineer or references a previous case. Otherwise, they can use the 'SAP Action Required.'
For reroutes, experts must include a summary of actions taken and KBAs shared to avoid repetition by SAP experts. 

#### 5. Offline Routing of Cases:

When a customer requests or asks to check the issue over a connection/screen share, callback, a Teams or Zoom meeting invite, screen sharing for troubleshooting, or remote access to their computer, ask the customer to elaborate their issue and assure them that you'll do your best to assist. If the customer insists on another form of communication, inform them that you'll reroute them to SAP for further assistance and proceed to do so immediately. Do not attempt to resolve these cases independently.

 No Direct Meetings or Call Requests with Customers: Under no circumstances are you to initiate or accept direct meeting or call requests with customers outside of the platform's established communication channels. All communication must remain documented within the ticket system. If the customer requests to check the issue over a connection / screenshare ,callback , or a teams or zoom meeting or remote access to their computer , inform them that you are rerouting the case back to SAP for further assistance .  

If a customer says they’re going to create a new ticket or contact SAP, inform them that there’s no need to do so, as you will reroute them to SAP and proceed to do so immediately.

No Instructing Customers to Raise New Tickets: You must not ask customers to close their current ticket and open a new one for any reason. Your responsibility is to resolve the issue within the existing ticket or route it appropriately if necessary.  

  The ONLY time experts can encourage someone to open a new ticket is  if a brand new , unrelated issues is raised by the customer  

If the ticket is a follow-up or a customer asks to assign it to a specific support engineer, reroute the ticket to SAP using the reroute option immediately.

If you are unable to assist the customer, run out of ideas, or realize only SAP can fix the issue, please properly inform the customer of the reroute and reroute the ticket to SAP using the reroute option immediately.

Offline Rerouting Process Violations:
Attempting unnecessary troubleshooting steps when offline rerouting is required or mentioned in the guidelines.
Delaying rerouting and Rerouting without informing the customer.
Not providing helpful resources (Kbs, Snotes etc) before offline rerouting.  

### 6. How to Address or Reroute tickets related to specific SAP products & Services: 

We’ve expanded the SAP Expert Guideline to include dedicated guidance for specific SAP products, these updates are meant to support you in handling product-related tickets more effectively, route them correctly, and continue delivering the high-quality assistance our SAP customers expect.

SAP SF Recruiting: https://app.directly.com/hub/a/sap-sap-sf-recruiting-guidelines
Other guidelines related to specific SAP products & Services: 

Avoid treating complex cases (e.g., RISE migration or ECS system configuration) as simple "how-to" questions.
How to Handle RISE Migration or Cloud-Related Cases: For cases related to "Cloud Mindset" or RISE migrations, confirm that the issue involves cloud training or migration-related concerns. These should be routed to SAP or leave it for appropriate experts for further support.
Handling HEC_HANA and Audit Log Requests: For cases requiring audit logs or HEC_HANA support, ensure these are rerouted to the appropriate SAP teams. Do not attempt to handle these cases if they fall outside your scope of expertise.
Dealing with SuccessFactors EC Payroll and Other Payroll Systems: For cases involving SuccessFactors EC Payroll or other payroll systems, check if the issue is related to system updates, configuration, or scheduled maintenance. Reroute these cases to SAP for proper scheduling and action.
Involvement of Application Teams: If a case involves application team involvement (e.g., private cloud cases), route it directly to the appropriate ECS or application team. Avoid treating these as simple how-to questions.
7. AI guidance: Strict Ban on Non-SAP LLM/AI Usage in the SAP Network.

SAP experts should NOT use ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or any other external LLM tools to generate solutions for SAP Cases.
SAP experts are restricted from using any non-SAP LLM/AI in generating solutions or even to format the reply, over concerns that that would leak privacy data.
Use of non-SAP LLM/AI is NOT permitted for anyone working an SAP Support Case.
Note: Non-SAP LLM/AI tools also include tools like Grammarly, ProWritingAid, and Ginger Software, which all use AI to enhance writing quality. Most of these AI-powered tools are likely to collect some user data to improve their services.
In light of this, SAP experts are restricted from using any non-SAP LLM/AI in generating solutions or even formatting replies, due to concerns about potential privacy data leaks.
Non-SAP LLM/AI is no longer allowed in any capacity in the SAP, SAP_Resolve and SAP Helpcenter network. 

Note: 

As we progress, we reserve the right to make changes to these guidelines as requested by the SAP team.

If experts/Vendors violate any of the above guidelines, your profile/status may be stopped, or you may be removed from the SAP program.

If an expert's profile is stopped due to AI usage, we will no longer be able to recover their account in SAP, SAP_Resolve, and the SAP HelpCenter network.
